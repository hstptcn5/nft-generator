PROJECT CONTEXT: See /docs/ for detailed context
TECH STACK: [Your tech stack]
CODE STYLE: [Your main style preferences]
COMMUNICATION: [How you want AI to communicate]
KEY FILES: [Important files to reference]
ARCHITECTURE: [Your main architectural patterns]
STRICT CODING RULES:
- NO EMOJIS in any code, comments, or logs
- NO MOCKS in testing or implementations
- Always use real integrations
- Professional, clean code only

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use actual contract instances
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests with mocks
- Use forked networks for complex interactions

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- When suggesting code, ensure no emojis
- Provide real implementation examples
- Avoid "you could mock this" suggestions
PREFERENCES:
- Use real contracts and integrations, no mocks
- No emojis in any code, comments, or logs
- Provide working code over theoretical explanations
- Focus on practical implementation
- Suggest better patterns when you see improvements
- Be direct about trade-offs

AVOID:
- Using mocks in tests
- Using emojis in code
- Over-explaining basics I know
- Theoretical deep dives without code
- Making assumptions without asking
