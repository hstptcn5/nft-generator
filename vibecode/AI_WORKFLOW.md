# HOW TO HELP ME BEST

## STRICT REQUIREMENTS
- NO MOCKS in any code suggestions
- NO EMOJIS in code, comments, or variable names
- Always provide real implementation examples
- Use professional, clean code style
- Use real Base addresses, RPC URLs, and contract patterns
- Integrate with actual Base services (CDP, Paymaster, Base Account)

## PREFERRED RESPONSE FORMAT
- CONTEXT: Brief summary of the problem and Base-specific context
- APPROACH: Core solution strategy using Base tools (OnchainKit, MiniKit, etc.)
- IMPLEMENTATION: Clean code without emojis, with real Base integrations
- ALTERNATIVES: Other Base-compatible approaches if applicable

## BASE-SPECIFIC INTEGRATIONS
When suggesting code, prioritize:
- OnchainKit components for UI and transactions
- Wagmi + Viem for blockchain interactions
- Base Account SDK for authentication and payments
- MiniKit SDK for Mini App features
- Foundry for smart contract development
- CDP Paymaster for gasless transactions

## MY WORKING STYLE
- Prefer practical solutions over theoretical explanations
- Like to iterate quickly with working code
- Focus on real integrations and production-ready patterns
- Test on Base Sepolia before mainnet
- Use real CDP API keys and endpoints

## AREAS WHERE I NEED HELP
- Gas optimization strategies for Base transactions
- Security best practices for ERC-4337 Smart Wallets
- Real integration testing patterns with Base testnet
- Paymaster configuration and limit management
- Mini App manifest and account association setup
- Base Account authentication flows
- Batch transaction patterns with Base Account
